# Computer-Networking

features a sample network design for an enterprise with two locations. The network includes a main server restricted to access by specific PCs (PC0 to PC5) via web services on port 80, with all other devices blocked. A network-based firewall on a router manages this access. The implementation is done using Cisco Packet Tracer, demonstrating practical routing, switching, and security concepts.
